if you accidentally delete a repo in the remote and you have made changes and updated
and you need to retrive this repo back with all files


go to local i have updated changes on vs code (which you have worked)
 then git log  ===you can see latest commit id
      git checkout <commit_id>
      git checkout -b <new branch>
      then create new repo in remote with same name
      git remote add origin repo url
      git commit -m "sdfghjk"
      git push -u origin main(if you are in master branch just switched to main branch===git checkout main
